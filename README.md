1. Write a description of what your program does and how does it work.

  Choosing game mode: P vs P
     Players names input, first player is X second is O.
     Game field visualization – after each move program prints the layout
     Players moves – each player makes one move in a row. Move is recorded as two numbers (1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 2 1, 2 2, 2 3, 3 1, 3 2 or 3 3).
     Program performs validity check – valid 1 to 3 and unused combination.
     After every move program starts evaluating outcomes and checking if one of the players has won.
     Winner is, when there are three similar signs (X or O) in a row, or column, or diagonal.

 2 Write multiple examples of user inputs and outputs, similar as you saw in exercise E.3.

  It is possible for users:
  1. to input X or O with place coordinates
  2. to print word "stop", to stop the game
